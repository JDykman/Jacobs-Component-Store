    "notes": "This reorganization groups components by their primary function, improving discoverability and maintainability.  The categories used are UI, data-display, feedback, and navigation.  This approach promotes a more intuitive structure for developers.\n\nArchitectural Recommendations:\n* Consider using a design system to enforce consistency across components.\n* Implement a robust testing strategy for all components.\n* Utilize a component library for common UI elements to reduce development time.\n\nNaming Conventions:\n* Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., MyComponent).\n* Ensure names are descriptive and self-explanatory.\n* Maintain consistency in naming across all components.\n\nMaintainability Improvements:\n* Regularly review and refactor components to ensure they remain efficient and well-structured.\n* Implement a linting tool to enforce coding standards.\n* Use version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.\n\nGrouping Rationale:\n* UI: General purpose components that don't fit neatly into other categories.\n* Data-display: Components for presenting data to the user (tables, lists, etc.).\n* Feedback: Components that provide feedback to the user (buttons, modals, progress indicators).\n* Navigation: Components that aid in navigation within the application (navbar, sidebar).\n\nFuture Considerations:\n* Explore adding a 'forms' category for form-related components.\n* Consider creating a dedicated category for layout components.\n* Implement a system for managing component dependencies.\n"
